# Janitor Commands
# ================

# In this section, you can define janitor_commands that are available to
# server janitors (server owners and possibly others, see server_janitors
# config option above).
#
# Each command has the following parameters:
# * id: Unique URL
# * name: human-readable description, should be short
# * action: should be either command or source:
#   * command: run the specified command, and return stdout, stderr to the
#              client. Note: the command path must be absolute, $PATH is not
#              used.
#   * source:  return (as application/octet-stream) the specified local file.
# * argument: the command string to execute or local file to serve, depending
#             on the value of action. You can insert Python format variables
#             into this string. These are substituted with values from GET
#             request query args, so shouldn't be sensitive info like
#             passwords, etc.  NOTE: User-supplied values must match the
#             following regex: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$
#
# Enabling janitor commands requires a server restart, but adding additional
# commands can be done with a reload.
